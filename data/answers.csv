Currently, the focus of Big Data development is still focused on data analysis and storage capacity because these two things are the most important factors in determining the level of effectiveness and success of the Big Data system. This has an impact on the lack of manpower and capital used to develop data security, resulting in various cases of data breaches and information theft. Currently, hackers and Big Data security continue to be developed continuously to ensure that systems that use Big Data are safe from data breaches and other forms of information theft and of course this requires frequent design changes or code updates. Even though this process takes a lot of time and effort. In addition, along with the development of the era and innovation of new technology implementations, the types of data are becoming more diverse, the size of the available data will grow exponentially. Moreover, considering that big data management is very different from conventional relational databases, sorting the desired data from the incoming data set is quite difficult. Data Availability One of the keys to conducting Big Data analysis is of course data availability. Access to data, both old and new data, can be an obstacle for Big Data, especially for old data that is stored in different and diverse forms, often even in physical form. Access to new data also requires more effort because permission and licenses are needed to legally access non-public data. Especially if there is a sectoral ego between agencies as data owners. This is what is felt by service and information providers who implement Big Data analytics in Indonesia, that the data collection phase is the main challenge. Actually in Indonesia, data for various types of needs is already available and abundant, but the sources are scattered, so more effort is needed to obtain integrated data nationally. Data Privacy On the one hand, data transparency is needed, but on the other hand, privacy is a sensitive issue and is often injured through technological advances. Privacy is related to a person's personal data that must be protected. The data used as Big Data, which is obtained directly from consumers, is much of it personal data and is very vulnerable to misuse by other parties. When one data alone requires guaranteed security, then when there is integration of data from several sources, the level of security must also be increased. This is because the data stored is not a little, but is related to many things. Technology This is related to the infrastructure and tools in operating Big Data, such as computing and analytical techniques, and storage media. It is undeniable that when you want to utilize Big Data technology, you must also be ready with the technology, such as the infrastructure and tools.

For example, humans learn a chess move today 1 time in half an hour. AI also does the same chess move today. Tomorrow, humans learn 1 more chess move. While AI has learned two chess moves, why?

Artificial Intelligence is actually a concept that has existed since Ancient Greece. Although the concept of AI has existed since ancient times, AI was only developed in the mid-20th century. Some experts define the meaning of AI. Artificial Intelligence is not only in the form of robots that can resemble humans. In general, there are 3 types of technology that are classified into Artificial Intelligence, namely. 1. Symbol-manipulating AI This type of Artificial Intelligence works with abstract symbols. The form of this type of AI experiment can be said to be the most when compared to other types of AI. The form of the experiment is that humans will be rearranged with hierarchical and logical levels. 2. Neural AI This type of Neural AI has been popular since the late 1980s among most computer scientists. By using this type of AI, knowledge will not be presented through symbols, but will be presented through an artificial brain. The knowledge that has been collected will be divided into neurons and then connected into several groups. 3. Neural Networks The type of Neural Network works with layers that are interconnected through simulation. At the top of the layer is the input layer that can function as a sensor. This sensor can be useful as a receiver of information that will later be processed into the system. At the very bottom of the neural network is the output layer which has a very small number of neurons. 3 Examples 1. Virtual Assistant There are many examples of platforms or hardware that provide this virtual assistant-based technology, for example Google Assistant, Amazon Alexa, Siri, and others. The task of this virtual assistant is to be able to record any information you need, as well as provide information related to your event time. In addition, virtual assistants can also be used to play music, send messages, open applications, and other advanced features. And the most interesting feature is the ability to know what you like and provide recommendations for content that you often watch or access on the internet. 2. Facebook Deepface The second example, developed by the giant company Facebook which has a feature to detect and recognize faces in photo posts. With this technology, you don't need to bother tagging photos manually. AI can recognize faces based on the data successfully obtained, which comes from recommendations or suggestions when you approve a photo that has been successfully tagged. 3. Recommendations on eCommerce This third example of implementation is often found when making online buying and selling transactions through a website or marketplace platform. Do you realize that when you look at products, in a few moments a search result will appear for recommendations for the products you have searched for. Well, that is the result of observations made by AI to help you find information on products or goods that you currently need.

Important points in the AI ​​process are learning, reasoning and self-correction. AI needs to learn to enrich its knowledge. The AI ​​learning process is not always ordered, but AI will learn by itself based on AI's experience when used by humans and correct itself if it is wrong.

In other words, AI is a computer system that can do jobs that generally require human power or human intelligence to complete the job. AI itself is a technology that requires data to be used as knowledge, just like humans. AI needs experience and data so that its intelligence can be even better. Important points in the AI ​​process are learning, reasoning and self-correction. AI needs to learn to enrich its knowledge. The AI ​​learning process is not always ordered by humans, but AI will learn by itself based on AI's experience when used by humans. The interesting thing about AI is that it is able to do self-correction or correct itself. If you have ever heard the expression AI If I never win, then at least I shouldn't lose, it's a little scary too. AI is indeed programmed to continue learning and improving itself from the mistakes it has made. AI Examples: 1. Facebook Deepface One example of AI is the DeepFace technology owned by Facebook. This AI functions to recognize people's faces in photo posts. With this technology, you no longer need to manually tag someone in the photo, because this AI will do it. You may be wondering, how does the AI ​​know that the person in the photo is you? You need to know that before AI can identify that the person in the photo is you, AI will be trained based on data. The data is obtained when you tag people in previous photos and from the results of AI suggestions for people in the photos that you approve. After AI trains and has a lot of data, AI will later be able to identify someone in the photo. 2. E-Commerce Recommendations One of the concepts of AI implementation that you often encounter is product recommendations on e-commerce. Maybe you have shopped at an e-commerce and when you shop there are products recommended for you. The recommended products are not from someone who predicts what you will buy. The recommended products are the result of the AI ​​process. Then where does AI get the products to be recommended? AI gets data from you yourself, for example when you search for products, purchase products and you have seen what products. This data will be processed from the AI ​​concept, namely data mining so that AI will recommend products that are right for you. 3. Virtual Assistant The next example of artificial intelligence is a virtual assistant, there are many providers of virtual assistants such as Google Assistant, Siri or Alexa. Like assistants in general, you can also interact with this virtual assistant. In addition, virtual assistants can record when you have an appointment or event and provide information when the specified event time is about to arrive. You can also order this virtual assistant to send messages, play music, open applications and so on. This virtual assistant will also continue to learn as you use it, so that the virtual assistant can find out what you like and what you usually do. Actually, there are many more examples of the application of AI, such as the AI ​​feature owned by the camera on a smartphone that can adjust the camera according to the conditions at that time.

std-uas-217,2,uas-2,uas,"Yes, and it has started to be implemented now. This is because the development of AI protocols for repetitive activities is relatively easy, because it does not require human factors of empathy, artistic sense, etc. An example is a telephone operator who uses automated messages.",2,2,3,3,2
std-uas-218,3,uas-2,uas,"Yes, because usually the questions asked to customer service tend to be the same. That way the data of questions asked by customers are combined and become training data that will later make it possible to become an algorithm to control the answering machine.",2,2,2,2,3
std-uas-219,4,uas-2,uas,"In my opinion, as time goes by, the work of Customer Service can be replaced by machines, this is by implementing AI technology.

std-uas-222,7,uas-2,uas,"I think it is possible as long as we can really understand the job and what problems might occur, because the machine is just a tool programmed to run it so there is still a big role of humans behind it. Humans must also be able to provide the right experience for the machine to complete the tasks that must be completed and humans must continue to measure how the machine performs in carrying out its tasks. The types of tasks and data given to the machine must be as accurate as possible, especially on the label so that the machine does not execute the wrong command deviating from the task it should. In addition to choosing the right label, we must also be able to extract and choose the right features to carry out the job, for example for Customer Service, the machine must be able to understand and respond to the words spoken by the person it is talking to correctly.",2,2,2,2,2
std-uas-223,8,uas-2,uas,"It could be replaced later. By building a certain algorithm, it is possible that the machine can act as a customer service.

Maybe someday a machine will be created that we can teach to be like customer service so that it can replace it, especially for other repetitive jobs. Machines need to be taught because technology needs data to be used as knowledge first before doing a job. Artificial Intelligence can also correct its own mistakes so that it can continue to learn from its own mistakes.",2,1,2,2,2
std-uas-227,12,uas-2,uas,"In my opinion, Customer Service work can be replaced by machines because repetitive work can be integrated with codes that allow repetitive questions to be answered by the machine after coding is done and this will speed up the delivery of answers from customer service to users.",2,2,3,3,2
std-uas-228,13,uas-2,uas,"Repetitive work, in my opinion, can be replaced by machines. This is because various technologies have now developed, especially in the era of the Industrial Revolution 4.0 towards 5.0 which is increasingly digitizing society. Various technologies such as the Internet of Things IoT and Artificial Intelligence AI already exist and have various capabilities that can compete with human capabilities that are repetitive in nature. This is because these systems have been designed to have human capabilities such as learning, making decisions, and correcting mistakes, and even tend to be more accurate than humans with the presence of Big Data. In addition, computers and machines are also considered more capable of managing data in larger quantities and faster than human capabilities. Therefore, as humans, we are also required to be more open and increasingly innovative so as not to lose out to machines that have been digitized.",2,2,2,2,2
std-uas-229,14,uas-2,uas,"Yes. A repetitive job can one day be replaced by a machine, because the job has a pattern that is needed by a machine to work. A machine can be trained using a machine learning system, so that it can process data accurately, as humans generally do a job.",2,2,2,2,2
std-uas-230,15,uas-2,uas,not everything can be replaced in my opinion because in certain cases the machine is less effective in understanding the message desired by the customer. but in repeated and the same cases because in the same and repeated cases with the use of the machine will make the process more effective and save more time.,2,2,2,3,2
std-uas-231,16,uas-2,uas,"Customer Service jobs and jobs that are repetitive in nature, will one day be replaced by machines because along with the times, technology is increasingly being developed, for example, CS at BNI bank if you want to make an ATM now you can use a machine like an ATM, gojek can use the bot feature if there is a complaint, and a refrigerator that can provide drinks according to what we choose if we have chosen a drink and paid for it with coins like abroad. these jobs are also repetitive jobs.",2,2,2,3,2
std-uas-232,17,uas-2,uas,"In my opinion, it can be replaced by machines, especially repetitive work. For example, customer service, now it can be replaced by chatbots.

std-uas-233,18,uas-2,uas,"In my opinion, the job can be replaced by machines. This is likely because technological developments will be increasingly rapid and machine intelligence will increase.

std-uas-234,19,uas-2,uas,"We will see more and more of AI used to manage customer service. However, this does not mean that AI customer service will completely replace human interaction in customer service. How a company treats its customers is critical to building its reputation and engagement rates. AI tools can quickly resolve high-urgency situations quickly, but when it comes to high-emotional scenarios, no AI can replicate human empathy, so there is still a benefit to having a real person helping customers. In conclusion, AI will continue to gradually replace human interaction in customer service, but there will always be a human behind it.",3,3,3,3,2
std-uas-235,20,uas-2,uas,"The use of AI in managing customer service is rampant. However, it does not mean that AI customer service will completely replace human interaction in the field of customer service. Customer service is very important in a company because they are the representatives of the company to build a reputation and increase engagement rates by serving customers well. AI can indeed quickly overcome situations with a high level of urgency quickly, but when it comes to scenarios that require high emotions, especially in the interaction with human customers, there is no AI that can imitate human empathy. In conclusion, the development of AI will continue to grow and AI can gradually replace human interaction in the field of customer service, but there will always be humans who hold control behind it.",2,3,3,3,2
std-uas-236,21,uas-2,uas,"Yes. Because as time progresses, technology also progresses. And there is a possibility of transformation from manual to digital. One of them is the Customer Service job which can be replaced by machines like restaurants in Japan that already have food ordering machines. This is because the job does repetitive activities so that it can be programmed by the machine so that it can save time and human energy.",3,3,3,3,2
std-uas-237,22,uas-2,uas,"In my opinion, the service department job can be replaced by AI. There is evidence such as hotels with robot receptionists in Japan and others. This can happen because the work is repetitive, the cases faced by customer service are the same cases almost every time, therefore AI can be programmed to deal with cases that are commonly experienced. In addition, CS work is not a job that requires morals, unlike police, judges, or others, which require the creation of moral machines, CS only faces general problems without having to think about morals.",2,2,2,3,2
std-uas-238,23,uas-2,uas,"In my opinion, Customer Service jobs and jobs that are repetitive in nature will one day be replaced by machines, but humans must still be present in the job as supervisors of the machines that work because there are some parts that cannot be replaced by machines. My reason that repetitive jobs will be replaced by machines is that existing machines are very programmable, they can be given a program algorithm so that they can perform a task continuously. With AI, machines can continue to improve their functions so that the repetitive tasks they have can be very effective and efficient. In addition, with Big Data Data analytics, the function of AI can be helped more because information about what the machine has done can be stored and analyzed into data that can be used to upgrade existing algorithms. As for my reason that human resources will still be used even if only as supervisors, is because some jobs such as customer service require individual review, namely the ability to understand bias and emotions possessed by humans because no matter how sophisticated the machines are made, they still cannot recognize the gray lines of emotions and the psyche of humans. A real example of this is the rechecking of YouTube videos by YouTube employees that were previously blocked by AI when the uploader claimed that their videos did not violate YouTube rules.",1,3,3,1,1
std-uas-239,24,uas-2,uas,"In my opinion, customer service jobs can be replaced by machines but are less effective. Because CS serves humans in general and every human has a very different nature so that machines are less able to help.",3,3,3,3,2
std-uas-240,25,uas-2,uas,"Jobs such as customer service and repetitive services can eventually be replaced by machines due to the development of technology that is getting better and bigger. There are already many like chatbots that replace it. Of course, this is not far from the development of increasingly sophisticated AI. However, in developing this AI, you must be careful so that the intelligence of AI does not exceed humans which can later cause AI to dominate humans.",2,2,2,2,2
std-uas-241,26,uas-2,uas,"Jobdesk carried out by a customer service officer is very monotone and easy to predict. Starting from answering customer complaints, diagnosing the source of service problems, to answering simple questions such as the price of a service or product of a business entity. This does not require the type of intelligence that is exclusively owned by humans such as emotion, intuition, creativity, and so on, so it will be very easy to replace with machines, especially in the context of the status quo where technological developments are very rapid and automation costs continue to decline. Sooner or later CS jobs will disappear due to automation.",2,2,2,2,2
std-uas-242,27,uas-2,uas,"Yes, it is not impossible that one day human work in the field of Costumer Service will be replaced by robots.

AI has the potential to solve problems and can even eliminate customer service jobs in companies.",2,2,2,2,2
std-uas-243,28,uas-2,uas,"Yes, I think it can be replaced. For example, on car tickets or temperature checkers that are sufficient with a computer. This can happen because of the development of artificial intelligence and IoT. Where there are sensors that connect to devices without human assistance, some are even wireless. This can happen because of the development of digital transformation that continues to increase.",2,3,3,3,2
std-uas-244,29,uas-2,uas,"Basically, Digital Transformation provides insight into digitalization so that repetitive human activities can be done by machines with the aim of eliminating the Human Error factor. Therefore, Customer Service work that is repetitive in nature CAN BE REPLACED BY MACHINES by compiling algorithms and programs that provide QnA Facilities so that the machine can provide services like Customer Service that is commonly known to the public today.",2,2,2,2,2
std-uas-245,30,uas-2,uas,"In my opinion, in the future, customer service is one of the jobs that can be replaced by machines. This is very possible considering that AI Artificial Intelligence technology is one of the important elements in the development of systems that can replace the role of customer service. Currently, the development of AI Artificial Intelligence is very rapid, even some e-commerce has implemented a customer service system that is served by bots, then for complex problems will be directed to human agents.

std-uas-246,31,uas-2,uas,,2,3,2,3,2
std-uas-247,32,uas-2,uas,"In my opinion, any job, including Customer Service, can be replaced by machines. Because it is undeniable that one day humans will increasingly want everything to be automatic and practical. However, there may be differences in the quality of service in Customer Service itself. After all, Customer Service serves customers directly and usually requires special skills in terms of communication, especially in conveying sympathy and empathy. This sympathy and empathy may not be able to be applied in the use of machines considering that sympathy and empathy and human feelings are complex and very varied, so if replaced by machines, then the machine must really have a human way of thinking.",2,3,2,2,2
std-uas-248,33,uas-2,uas,"In my opinion, the work of Customer Service will one day be replaced by machines. This is because the nature of the service carried out by customer service is a repetitive nature so that this can be taught, applied, simulated to the machine. There is data that is given to the machine and has been understood by the machine as features, then a target or label is also given for the results of the service based on the data so that later the machine can automate work to provide services based on the features and labels that have been given or the system is able to analyze the correlation between existing data to produce service action targets.",2,3,2,2,2
std-uas-249,34,uas-2,uas,Jobs such as customer service that are repetitive in nature are likely to be replaced by machines in the future. It is likely that in the future an artificial intelligence system will be created that will then take over the role of the job.,2,3,2,3,2
std-uas-250,35,uas-2,uas,"In my opinion, the job will one day be replaced by machine learning and training with lots of data. However, in my opinion, only general and frequently occurring cases can be replaced. For certain cases and detailed cases, they cannot be replaced yet, because the job is tasked with serving humans who have their own nature and problems.",2,2,2,3,2
std-uas-251,36,uas-2,uas,"Customer Service work is a job that can only be obtained by a certain skill. If machines take over this job, then there will likely be many discrepancies. Humans are basically creatures who have feelings and have the ability to improvise. AI in customer service is a mistake, because it requires human power that is able to improvise. The command given to AI is only one at a certain time, if the command is changed then the decision is canceled because it does not match the initial command. Meanwhile, if humans become customer service, the command can be changed without having to negate the previous command. In addition, in AI practice. The grammar used is grammar that is in accordance with the book. Sometimes humans don't need that, but how can customer service adjust to human needs without being too rigid like a machine. Work will never be able to be replaced 100% by machines, there are still human hands as translators of the shortcomings and rigidity of a machine.",2,2,2,3,2
std-uas-252,37,uas-2,uas,"Yes, currently AI has developed that allows it to do work that can be done by humans.

std-uas-254,39,uas-2,uas,"Customer Service jobs are possible to be replaced by machines using AI Artificial Intelligence. AI has the ability to act or behave intelligently like humans. Therefore, AI is able to do jobs that are generally done by humans.",3,2,3,3,3
std-uas-255,40,uas-2,uas,"I think it is possible. This is because the digital transformation that is currently happening is so rapid. IT experts and scientists are trying to create various innovations to speed up human work, places to learn programming are increasing and free. Currently, there are already several countries that use robots as Customer Services, for example in Japan, so it is possible that in the next 10 years, Customer Services and repetitive service work will be done by robots in various places in the world, humans are only tasked with supervising them.",2,2,2,2,2
std-uas-256,41,uas-2,uas,"The role of customer service is as a problem solver when there are complaints or questions from consumers. Usually we will be connected and can talk directly to them, after contacting and pressing a certain button. Reportedly this AI will start to replace the original role of CS. This AI is set to be able to answer various problems that are often asked by consumers and respond to them based on the frequency of the problems faced. Data from the MIT Technology Review sponsored by Genesys shows that 91 iconic companies with the highest level of customer experience CX - customer experience and world-class brand recognition use AI Artificial Intelligence solutions to improve their customer satisfaction, compared to 42 other companies engaged in the same field as a whole. If we look at it briefly, this will make it easier for customers. This AI can work for 24 hours non-stop. Customers will be satisfied and do not need to wait until CS working hours if they want to complain or ask a problem. And the longer the AI ​​​​works, the more data is stored and the AI ​​​​is getting smarter in serving customers. However, if some customers are not satisfied with the service from AI, usually applications that use AI facilitate the Real Customer Service alternative. Therefore, I think that over time, the work of Customer Service will be replaced little by little because I believe that AI will develop much further than what we see now.",3,3,3,3,3
std-uas-257,42,uas-2,uas,"Yes, it can happen. The reason is that with the development of the era, various technologies can be found that are increasingly advanced and sophisticated and make human work easier. This happens in various fields, including the field of public services. For example, the discovery of AI for the customer service section. The system can be run by entering data on FAQ Frequently Asked Questions and several other question data that may have been asked by customers before. The system can understand customer question patterns and predict the right answers. The system can also find troubleshooting and solutions to various problems. That way, AI can answer various customer questions accurately and quickly. Therefore, human work in the customer service section is replaced by machines.",2,2,2,3,2
std-uas-258,43,uas-2,uas,"It is possible. AI technology in machines can answer thousands of questions by detecting grammatical errors, pronunciation mistakes, and colloquialisms. This technology can help in getting faster than humans can get so that work becomes more efficient.",2,2,3,2,2
std-uas-259,44,uas-2,uas,"Yes, because those jobs have patterns that can be made into program flows according to what the customer wants. When a customer experiences a particular problem, the system can solve the problem by continuing to the next handling step.",2,2,2,1,2
std-uas-260,45,uas-2,uas,"Yes, because repetitive work will be easier to respond to using templates or now commonly called bots, we only need to enter commands or keywords so that the response will follow the keywords in our message.

std-uas-266,51,uas-2,uas,"Yes, I think that Customer Service jobs and jobs that are repetitive in nature, will one day be replaced by machines. This is because currently there are already companies that implement Natural Language Processing NLP, a type of artificial intelligence, and machine vision to identify customers so that companies can contact and respond to customers automatically or direct them to the right agent. Another example is doing call classification where NLP will identify what customers want so that customer service agents can focus their activities on things that are of high value to customers. Therefore, in the future there is a possibility that in the future Customer Service jobs and jobs that are repetitive in nature, will really be replaced by machines.",1,1,2,1,1

With machine learning technology from AI, jobs like customer service can be done by machines that can learn from several questions or cases faced by users to answer the solutions that must be done. This application has also been widely implemented by several companies, for example, telecommunications companies such as By.u have an automatic CS named Nindy and Telkomsel with the name Veronika.",2,2,2,2,2

If we look at it briefly, this will make it easier for customers. This AI can work for 24 hours non-stop. Customers will be satisfied and do not need to wait until CS working hours if they want to complain or ask a problem. Is that enough? If you look at it, it seems that CS will slowly be replaced by this robot. But will it be completely replaced? If I look at the role of CS which is the recipient and problem solver, it still requires interaction. However, robots with AI will carry out tasks according to the command code that has been set in their artificial brains.

In a lecture on AI, Mr. Sunu explained that now there is an algorithm that can create imitation sounds from human voices. It is even shown in Mr. Sunu's Lecture video, an image can speak like a human. Even though it is purely machine-made. For jobs such as customer service, it is certainly similar to that. AI is also one way to automate various things. With AI and Machine Learning, the more data is input, the more accurate the output will be. For example, the work of a cashier, they can replace it with a machine with an image sensor, so that it can recognize goods and prices.

std-uas-279,64,uas-2,uas,"Customer service can be replaced by machines. Developers can create applications to receive questions and criticisms from consumers. A collection of frequently asked questions can be managed by categorizing them so that it is easier for customers to find answers to the problems they face. Applications can be implemented on smartphones or developed as websites to make them easier for customers to access. The work scheme can be described as follows. Customers have an ID in the form of a name or user number that is used to log in to the system and functions as a customer identity to convey criticism or questions that require follow-up. Then there is an option that directs customers to be more specific towards the problems they are experiencing. The system will process customer data and then deliver the output of the answer to the problem. If the problem requires follow-up from the store, customers will be given directions for further action.

Robots can be set to be able to answer various problems that are often asked by consumers and respond to them based on how often the problems are faced. In addition, the use of this technology will be more effective and cost-effective. However, humans have diverse thoughts so that if there are consumers who ask outside of common problems that rarely occur, it is feared that the robot will feel confused.

The role of customer service is as a problem solver when there are complaints or questions from consumers. However, sometimes the problems that can be answered by AI are only general command problems. If a customer has a complex problem that requires problem analysis skills, of course human customer service is needed.

The construction of the house that is done can be completed in less than 24 hours, where if using workers the time will be longer which ultimately leads to more money being spent. However, there are some jobs that cannot be replaced by machines, in my opinion these jobs are jobs such as politicians, painters, filmmakers, writers, inventors and so on.

std-uas-327,112,uas-2,uas,"Yes. Customer Service and repetitive work have procedures that can be arranged in such a way and taught to AI. So, it is possible that Customer Service and the like will be replaced by machines while humans will only handle conditional problems.",2,2,2,2,2
std-uas-328,113,uas-2,uas,"Yes, it can. Because of the rapid development of AI, Customer Service and repetitive service jobs will one day be replaced by machines.

std-uas-330,115,uas-2,uas,"In my opinion, Yes, Customer Service jobs can one day be replaced by machines. Because seeing the rapid development of Artificial Intelligence, where the Customer Service system is repetitive so that it can be replaced by machines. The Artificial Intelligence system will answer consumer problems and provide responses to problems that are often asked by customers. AI will later be tasked according to the command code that has been set in its artificial brain. Artificial intelligence that may be used in machine learning. The system patterns that can be utilized include searching, perception, the purpose of which is to perceive each incoming stimulus, the stimulus can be in the form of audio, video, and planning the pattern of the stimulus data collection that will be input so that it can predict the same pattern and then can provide the appropriate answer to the customer.",2,2,3,2,2
std-uas-331,116,uas-2,uas,"Yes, it can be if the AI ​​that is developed is very optimal. Due to the rapid development of AI, Customer Service and repetitive service jobs will one day be replaced by machines. AI will begin to replace the original role of CS and be set to be able to answer various problems that consumers often ask and respond to them based on the frequency of the problems faced. AI will carry out tasks according to the command code that has been set in its artificial brain. However, if a consumer asks outside of common problems that rarely occur. It could be that the robot will be confused. Therefore, in my opinion, this CS job will still survive until the AI ​​that is developed is truly optimal.",2,2,3,3,3
std-uas-332,117,uas-2,uas,"In my opinion, Customer Service and repetitive service jobs will be replaced by machines, such as machine learning. Artificial intelligence that may be used in machine learning is searching, perception, perceiving every incoming stimulus, the stimulus can be audio, video, and so on, and planning the pattern of the data collection or input stimulus so that it can predict the next pattern and provide the right answer to the customer who asks.",2,2,2,2,2
std-uas-333,118,uas-2,uas,"Customer Service jobs and jobs that are repetitive in nature can be replaced by machines. This happens because the more advanced the era of AI technology is, the more it develops. AI technology such as chatbots in applications will begin to replace the role of customer service in serving customers. This AI technology is set to be able to answer various problems that are often asked by consumers and respond to them based on data obtained from input or data received from previous consumers. AI technology will carry out its duties according to the command code that has been set in its artificial brain. In addition, with this AI technology, work becomes easier and the costs incurred are also less than if you had to employ humans.",2,1,3,1,2

std-uas-335,120,uas-2,uas,"Customer Service jobs and jobs that are repetitive in nature will one day be replaced by machines or robots because along with the development of technology with the presence of AI, IoT, the industry will produce robots that can learn on their own, especially if the job is repetitive. Robots will easily learn it.",3,3,3,3,2
std-uas-336,121,uas-2,uas,"Yes, because all repetitive work or static, procedural, repetitive work is only a matter of time to be replaced by a new process, which is more efficient, namely robots. Because robots are artificial intelligence technology or artificial intelligence which means technology that allows robots to imitate human motor skills. Repetitive work can be taught to computers through machine learning where computers learn through experience to perform a task and their performance can be measured. However, for specific and specialist jobs it will be possible not to be replaced.",2,3,2,3,2
std-uas-337,122,uas-2,uas,"Of course you can. In AI, there is machine learning and deep learning that are currently developing among researchers. Machine learning and deep learning can learn something based on cases or samples that are trained in machine learning and deep learning so that this can be done continuously when the cases or data samples that are trained already cover all existing cases. The drawback is when there is a data anomaly, it will cause the system to error or fail to be detected.",2,2,2,3,2
std-uas-338,123,uas-2,uas,"In my opinion, it is very possible, even now there is an application of customer service services that are acting up that have been replaced by machine systems. And this is a product of Artificial Intelligence. The reason for replacing the job in my opinion is to facilitate human work in this case, those who work as customer service. Because many users, it can even be said that almost all humans use it, it will make the service a bit confused if it only relies on human power, I take an example of a cellular card operator, almost everyone who has a cellphone must have a cellular card or starter card where we have a kind of ID that has a number or is usually called a cellphone number. When the service from the starter card is disrupted, users will automatically complain and if all of Indonesia complains, of course for customer service it is a disaster, therefore an artificial intelligence is created that facilitates the work of the customer service in answering questions from users who are only the same, why are they only the same? Because the desires and complaints of each user will be different, for that customer service is still needed by humans, because as smart as artificial intelligence is, it will never beat the intelligence that makes it, namely natural intelligence, human intelligence.",3,3,3,3,3
std-uas-339,124,uas-2,uas,"Yes, because customer service work and repetitive work can be analyzed, studied and then made into robot machines that can imitate their work by utilizing AI Artificial Intelligence. Customer Service CS usually works to handle problems and complaints asked by customers, AI can be set to be able to answer various problems that are often asked by consumers and respond to them based on the frequency of the problems faced. If we look at it briefly, this will make it easier for customers. This AI can work for 24 hours non-stop. Customers will be satisfied and do not need to wait until CS working hours if they want to complain or ask a problem. That way, one day this CS job will slowly be replaced by robots. And for repetitive work, it can be replaced by machines that utilize AI, AI is set to be able to imitate movements and how it works. This machine will be more profitable for the company because it does not need to recruit workers and can save costs, more efficiently and effectively, That way, of course one day the job can be replaced by machines.",3,3,2,3,2
std-uas-340,125,uas-2,uas,"with the development of technology lately, in my opinion, customer service jobs can be replaced by AI technology. This is because computers have the advantage of categorizing many consumer problems into several other similar sub-problems that have been solved.",2,2,2,2,2
std-uas-341,126,uas-2,uas,"In my opinion, it is very possible because now there is already OK Google which in the future could become an AI customer service that replaces humans.",3,3,3,3,3
std-uas-342,127,uas-2,uas,"Yes. The reason is that with the development of the era, the technology created by researchers has become more advanced, including in the field of public services. For example, through machine learning where data regarding FAQ Frequently Asked Questions and some data that may be asked by customers can be entered to be studied by the machine. Through the experience gained, the machine will gradually begin to adapt so that it can answer questions and problems raised by customers accurately. Thus, AI can be an effective solution to ease humans so that in the future human services as customer service are no longer needed.",2,2,2,2,2
std-uas-343,128,uas-2,uas,"Yes, it is possible that jobs such as Customer Service and jobs that are repetitive in nature in the future can be replaced by machines because day by day, technology in Indonesia and even in the world will always develop. The development of this technology affects various fields, one of which is public service.

std-uas-345,130,uas-2,uas,"In my opinion, the work of Customer Service and work that is of a service nature can be replaced by machines. And as far as I know, it has happened, such as the example of a provider's customer service. This aims to make it easier and help classify the problems that customers want to ask.",2,2,2,2,2
std-uas-346,131,uas-2,uas,I think that repetitive service jobs can be replaced by machines. Even customer service jobs have started to be replaced by chatbots. Repetitive jobs require a lot of manpower and will be more efficient if replaced by an AI machine. Repetitive memorizing jobs are easy to imitate and learn by AI machine learning,2,2,2,3,2
std-uas-347,132,uas-2,uas,"Yes, this job has the potential to be replaced by machines because with repetition, it can be covered by artificial intelligence, where the system can learn the data provided and with a number of algorithms can be translated according to the desired command.",2,3,2,2,2
std-uas-348,133,uas-2,uas,"In my opinion, this is very possible. Nowadays, real-time automated customer service is rampant, which is able to answer customer questions in a split second. And as time goes by, this customer service may be replaced by machines as voice assistants develop that are able to replace human presence.",2,2,2,2,2
std-uas-349,134,uas-2,uas,"I think the Customer Service job could be replaced by machines in the future, because currently there is Google Assistant that can respond to our chats. However, this requires a lot of optimization because there will be many difficulties, such as differences in customer accents, the volume of customer voices, and very varied sentence structures.",2,2,2,3,2
std-uas-350,135,uas-2,uas,"Yes. This is because technological development is very fast. According to a theory that states that technological development moves exponentially, the development of technology in the last 100 years exceeds the development of technology in 3000 years of human civilization. This is what causes technology to be created in the future that is capable of doing various things. For example, customer service whose service nature is repetitive and static, then one day in the future when an AI type of Artificial General Intelligence has been created, it is undeniable that computers or machines have been reliable and capable of carrying out customer service tasks, especially if there is an AI type of Artificial Super Intelligence, then almost all fields can be done by machines or computers. Enough at the general level, systems or computers have been able to replace certain positions, for example customer service whose work nature is repetitive and static.",2,2,2,2,2
std-uas-351,136,uas-2,uas,"If the question focuses on a certain moment, I will answer yes, the customer service job will be replaced by a machine one day, if it is very perfect because not all customers will ask the same questions every time, what if the customer asks questions outside the programmed questions, of course this requires humans who can answer them.",2,2,2,2,2
std-uas-352,137,uas-2,uas,"In my opinion, Customer Service jobs and jobs that are repetitive in nature, will one day be replaced by machines. Of course, this can be replaced by artificial intelligence.",2,2,2,2,2
std-uas-353,138,uas-2,uas,"Yes, customer service will be replaced by machines. With artificial intelligence, technology can become an innovator and decision maker. For example, currently, customer service texts on social media are mostly done by chatbots.",2,2,2,2,2
std-uas-354,139,uas-2,uas,"In my opinion, Customer Service jobs and jobs that are repetitive in nature will be replaced by machines. This is very possible to happen because it follows the concept of AI Artificial Intelligence, namely repetitive jobs can be taught or implemented to computers through machine learning where computers learn through experience or experience to perform a task. We can measure how accurate the performance or performance of the computer is.",4,4,4,4,4
std-uas-355,140,uas-2,uas,"I think yes. Jobs that are repetitive in nature can be replaced by AI. AI can learn from repeated experiences, analyze the data, and make decisions based on what it learns. So the use of AI can increase efficiency. I think this is very possible.",4,4,4,3,4
std-uas-356,141,uas-2,uas,"In my opinion, customer service jobs and repetitive service jobs can be replaced by machines because machines can be programmed to do repetitive work, machines will make fewer mistakes. Errors that have occurred cannot be repeated on the machine because they become warning data for the machine. The machine only needs more power to produce more results, and the machine can use keywords to detect the needs of its consumers so that the machine can provide answers to the results that the consumer wants.",4,4,4,4,4
std-uas-357,142,uas-2,uas,"With the industrial revolution 4.0, technology is developing very rapidly and quickly.

std-uas-362,147,uas-2,uas,"In my opinion, Customer Service jobs and jobs that are repetitive in nature, will one day be replaced by machines because technology is developing, humanoid research is increasing, and applications in various fields are also increasingly widespread. The role of robots designed with artificial intelligence is expected to be able to further assist human work. So that work will be completed faster, because as we know robots will not get tired and will not chat in between their work. The efficiency of time and energy of this robot is very high.",4,5,4,5,4
std-uas-363,148,uas-2,uas,"It could be because jobs like this are now often replaced by AI, such as online shopping, health consultations, reservations, and others. This is called a chatbot. Chatbots can indeed provide interactive information services that are even 24 hours. Chatbots themselves can also store customer information that can be a benefit for companies, especially in the interests of marketing and product innovation. Therefore, Chatbots can actually be a disruption for Customer Service because of course with cheaper costs and more and more effective work done., of course Chatbots can replace their jobs.",5,4,5,5,5
std-uas-364,149,uas-2,uas,"Yes, it can. These jobs are repetitive so machines can be programmed to replace humans in these jobs by training the machine to think like a human. The processes that might be done to program the machine are Learning, Decision Making, and Self Correction.",4,4,4,5,4
std-uas-365,150,uas-2,uas,"In my opinion, customer service jobs will be replaced by machines in the future. Customer service will be replaced by systems that can answer automatically, such as Siri on the iPhone. This can be based on technological developments, especially in artificial intelligence.

At first glance, this will make it easier for customers because this AI can work for 24 hours non-stop. Customers will be happy and do not need to wait for CS's turn to answer if they want to complain or ask a question. However, when viewed from the role of CS which is the recipient and problem solver, of course interaction is needed. Sometimes the interaction between humans and each other cannot be replaced by robots. AI only responds to questions that have been set in it. However, if there are other questions outside the settings, then that will be a shortcoming of AI. Therefore, in my opinion, this CS job will still survive until the AI ​​that is developed is truly optimal. Because humans need interaction between each other which is not obtained by AI.",5,5,5,5,4

For example, currently the role of AI in the CS area is quite large and the goal is to increase customer satisfaction such as social listening and ticketing. Companies can utilize Natural Language Processing NLP, a type of artificial intelligence, and machine vision to identify customers so that companies can contact and respond to customers automatically or direct them to the right agent. However, this work, if it is still related to humans, still cannot be replaced by machines as a whole because of the need for feelings, something that machines do not or do not currently have, in human communication.",4,5,5,5,4

On the one hand, industry 4.0 brings various positive advances, especially in terms of technology. But on the other hand, industry 4.0 makes humans not only compete with other humans, but also with robots. Minister of Communication and Information Rudiantara said that repetitive jobs are very likely to be replaced by robots.

Moreover, human-to-human interaction cannot be completely replaced by robots. So in my opinion, robots cannot replace the role of customer service completely.",4,4,4,3,4
std-uas-380,165,uas-2,uas,"Yes, it can. Slowly, it can happen. Because of the development of the era and the sophistication of technology, customer service can be replaced as a system on a computer or smartphone that can be accessed from home or replaced by a robot. This is done because it is more efficient and reduces salary expenses",4,4,4,4,3
std-uas-381,166,uas-2,uas,"Yes, it can, this is because there is already artificial intelligence, where humans can form a program that is intended to serve a repetitive response. With the history of previous work, AI will take the response with the best outcome based on the existing historical service journey and data will always be developed based on the responses obtained, this is what makes work that is repetitive in nature can be replaced because of the tendency of AI to continue updating data to improve services based on the response and historical response data received.",4,4,4,4,4
std-uas-382,167,uas-2,uas,"In my opinion, customer service jobs can be replaced by machines, but not completely. The many complaints and needs of product users will be more effective if assisted by certain machines or programs, for example, the program can group categories of complaints from product users and direct users to the claim page for returning goods due to defects or to other pages according to the complaints submitted. A company can also design a program with an algorithm that can filter which user complaints can be handled and which are spam, or a program that can also store user complaint data as research on product quality. However, to be able to serve product users in certain activities, for example to return goods or improve the quality of goods, it still has to be done by humans. Machines or programs are only tools that support or help customer service run efficiently. In my opinion, customer service sometimes also requires interaction that must be done with other humans, for example, in order to build trust with product users, telephone services must still run. I liken this to an application that offers to chat with AI. Some may argue that psychologists will no longer be needed if applications like this develop, but in fact, interacting with AI and interacting with humans are very different. There are certain things that cannot be found when someone interacts with AI compared to interacting with humans.

std-uas-383,168,uas-2,uas,"In my opinion, the work of Customer Service can be replaced by machines, with the condition that the commands or services given are in the form of the same repetition over and over again. The AI ​​system can be programmed to process these commands automatically with the same output. This has advantages in terms of efficiency of energy, time, and cost compared to customer service in the form of humans who have limited energy and get tired if they answer the same questions over and over again. However, AI also has limitations when faced with complex and varied questions, for example the answers to the questions asked can be more than one and require further explanation. In this case, the role of customer service is still needed even though most of its roles can be replaced by AI. Workers in the field of customer service can answer consumer questions that require complex explanations and outside the automatic answer program programmed into the AI ​​system.",4,5,5,5,4

As we know, the role of customer service itself is to serve customer complaints where in interacting and communicating they are filled with many questions in various languages ​​that are likely difficult to understand. Using machines to replace humans in service-based professions is an interesting idea. However, in its implementation, robots need to be taught to answer various questions that are asked periodically and to detect grammatical errors, pronunciation errors, and everyday language. Therefore, this idea requires further development first.",4,5,5,5,4

In addition, machines do carry out tasks, but only humans can truly provide service. Machines may be able to do it faster and more accurately than humans, but they cannot show appreciation or understand true human feelings.

std-uas-390,175,uas-2,uas,"In my opinion, Customer Service jobs and jobs that are repetitive in nature, will one day be replaced by machines. This is due to the development of increasingly advanced AI. However, it still cannot be completely replaced, this is because Customer Service, a repetitive service job, has the task of serving complaints from customers, which complaints may not be common. So AI cannot detect it and solve the problem. So there still needs to be humans who do the job, although not in large numbers, because some other tasks can be replaced by robots. For example, several restaurants in Japan already use robots as waiters, but there are still humans who monitor the robots, and are on guard if there are customers who file complaints.",5,4,5,5,5
std-uas-391,176,uas-2,uas,"In my opinion, in the near future some CS jobs will be replaced by machines. Even now, many customer services already provide a list of frequently asked questions, because the problems complained about tend to be uniform. An AI system that is trained with reinforcement learning may be able to replace humans entirely, but it seems to require a large training set so it is too expensive to realize now.",4,4,5,5,4
std-uas-392,177,uas-2,uas,"CS jobs and those that are free can certainly be replaced by machines because we can see at this time that there are already many technology-based services. Technology that is always developing at all times is directly proportional to human intelligence and abilities that are also increasingly developing. More and more new innovations will emerge and make jobs like CS will be replaced. However, there will also be many new jobs that emerge, but behind sophisticated technology there will always be humans behind it who regulate and supervise.",4,5,5,5,3
std-uas-393,178,uas-2,uas,"Yes, customer service work is a repetitive job such as answering several questions asked either via telephone, email and most recently via chat. One day the customer service task will be replaced by artificial intelligence. Now there are startups that are developing it such as Kata.ai and botika",5,5,5,4,5
std-uas-394,179,uas-2,uas,"In my opinion, Customer Service will one day be replaced by machines such as machine learning. The reason is that many companies such as banks and marketing from a company use AI-based machine learning to handle consumer questions and complaints. Machine learning is a machine that is developed to be able to learn by itself without direction from its users. Machine learning has the ability to obtain existing data with commands from itself. The way machine learning works itself is different but still on the same basic principle, namely collecting data, exploring data, selecting work methods, providing training for the selected model, and evaluating the results of machine learning.",4,5,5,5,4
std-uas-395,180,uas-2,uas,"In my opinion, Customer Service jobs and jobs that are repetitive in nature, can one day be replaced by machines but cannot be 100% the same as humans. As the digital age develops, the role of humans will slowly be replaced by machines that continue to develop, for example customer service which is replaced by the implementation of AI-based chatbots. Machines can respond faster and are available at all times, while humans cannot be active 247, but AI cannot answer spontaneously like humans, AI must be programmed first, so that if there are questions outside those that have been programmed, AI cannot answer them, at the next opportunity AI can only answer them after it recognizes the question. Artificial Intelligence that might be used in machine learning is Searching, perception prepares each input stimulus, stimuli can be in the form of video, audio, photos, etc., and plans patterns from a collection of input stimulus data so that it can predict the next pattern and can answer customer questions that ask with the appropriate answer.",5,5,5,5,5
std-uas-396,181,uas-2,uas,"No. In my opinion, jobs like customer service require human communication skills that machines do not yet have. Machines can currently only communicate simply with programmed sentences or replies, while customer service jobs require effective two-way communication. There are still many human characteristics that cannot be implemented in machines, such as non-verbal communication, controlled emotions, assertiveness, netiquette, appropriate tone of voice, and adequate responses so as not to offend the customer. So, for now, machines still cannot replace humans in customer service jobs or jobs that require repetitive services.",4,1,5,4,3
std-uas-397,182,uas-2,uas,"I think yes, because as time goes by and the development of the era, the sophistication of technology created by human thought will certainly advance.

std-uas-398,183,uas-2,uas,"I think it is possible, because the job of Costumer Service is a job that tends to have a repetitive pattern.

std-uas-399,184,uas-2,uas,"In my opinion, Customer Service jobs and jobs that are repetitive in nature, will one day be replaced by machines because the era is getting more advanced with the presence of IoT, big data, and other programming. IoT is a technology trend that is increasingly being discussed and is considered important for the industry. Work can be overcome with increasingly diverse devices that are increasingly smart. IoT plays a role in providing real-time visibility that complements corporate resource planning data and accounting systems, thus providing a comprehensive view. Along with the development of the era, humans have succeeded in finding various technologies that are useful for everyday life. There have been many technological innovations that are now present in society. This was created solely to meet the daily needs of humans.",4,4,4,4,4
std-uas-400,185,uas-2,uas,"Yes, I think that customer service jobs that are repetitive in nature can be replaced by machines.

This also makes it easier to serve many customers simultaneously, and also makes it easier to store databases, so that the database will be stored automatically, neatly and orderly.",5,4,5,4,3
std-uas-401,186,uas-2,uas,"I think that service jobs can be replaced by machines. One example is the use of online applications to perform a service. Currently, in Indonesia there are service provider applications, such as the Halodoc application.",5,3,5,4,3
std-uas-402,187,uas-2,uas,"In my opinion, one day there is a possibility that repetitive service work will use machines. The use of machines for repetitive services can be found every day, when shopping online and having questions, we can send orders or chat to customer service controlled by the system. The system will then give us questions that can direct us as customers to the desired service. This is also done by call center operators where the machine will direct customers to the appropriate admin. However, for customer service who will serve customers, in my opinion, it will still be human. This is because customer questions can consist of various things and the system cannot necessarily understand what different customers want because a system only understands what is inputted into it. Therefore, although there is a possibility that machines can replace repetitive services, these machines will only increase the efficiency of the service. For the interaction itself, from customers to admins or waiters, it will still be held by humans.",4,5,5,5,3
std-uas-403,188,uas-2,uas,"Yes. If we look at the development of AI aka Artificial Intelligence, it is increasingly advanced. The role of robots designed with artificial intelligence is expected to be able to further assist human work. So that work will be completed faster, because as we know robots will not get tired and will not chat in between their work. The efficiency of time and energy of this robot is very high. This AI is set to be able to answer various problems that consumers often ask and respond to them based on the frequency of the problems faced.",5,4,4,4,4
std-uas-404,189,uas-2,uas,"In my opinion, Customer Service jobs and jobs that are repetitive in nature could one day be replaced by machines. This is supported by the existence of AI that can understand and respond to human speech. Work done by machines can also save expenses because machines do not need to be paid, and machines can do their jobs at any time. It's just that for now, the existing AI is not yet sensitive enough to understand Indonesian, so to achieve the service being replaced by machines, there must be developments in language detection technology",4,4,4,4,4
std-uas-405,190,uas-2,uas,"In my opinion, the work of Customer Service and work that is repetitive in nature, will one day be replaced by machines. This happens because the work system of Customer Service will be replaced by machine learning. One of the Artificial Intelligence used, namely searching, perception perceives every wave of incoming stimulus, such as sound, images, to videos, to make a planning of the patterns of inputted stimulus data collections. Therefore, the next pattern in the Customer Service service system can be predicted and learned by machines. So, it can provide the right answer to satisfy customers when asking. One example of machine learning that replaces conventional Customer Service services, namely Siri from the Apple Technology company, and Ok Google from Google.",5,5,5,5,5
std-uas-406,191,uas-2,uas,"Yes, I think customer service jobs and jobs that are repetitive in nature can be replaced by machines. Digitalization of services and human labor can be replaced by AI. Artificial Intelligence that processes natural language processing and speech recognition such as Siri and Alexa can replace customer service jobs because they are designed to respond to commands and answer questions by translating spoken language into text by computers, for example with STT or speech to text software or speech recognition programs. The computer will input sound vibrations and then convert them into a digital format that the computer can understand. Repetitive jobs can also be replaced by machines because computers can learn a response to a particular command or question, not create it. Smart speakers connected to the internet or a database can also speed up the work process compared to human labor.",5,5,5,5,4

We can use Artificial Intelligence, namely the searching feature, perception perceives every incoming stimulus, such as video, audio and others, and also plans the pattern of the data collection or inputted stimulus so that the machine can predict the next pattern and provide the answer desired by the customer. We can see this in the Google Assistant application.",5,4,5,5,4
std-uas-408,193,uas-2,uas,"I think yes, it can be replaced by machines. Because a job that is repetitive static, procedural, repetitive can be replaced by a new process, which is more efficient, such as computers and robots. These computers and robots have artificial intelligence technology, technology that allows them to imitate human motor skills, which work can be taught to computers and robots through machine learning where computers and robots will learn through experience to perform a task and their performance can be measured. This is the reason why these jobs can one day be replaced by machines.",5,4,5,5,4

std-uas-410,195,uas-2,uas,"In my opinion, machines will not be able to completely replace Customer Service or other service jobs, but rather help the performance of the field. For example, Artificial Intelligence can be used to improve the quality and efficiency of Customer Service by helping to direct messages from customers to the right servers automatically, and customers no longer have to manually perform steps that can be troublesome in order to be connected to a server.",4,4,5,4,4

Companies only need to teach robots to answer thousands of questions that are likely to be asked. However, considering the difficulty of learning a language that basically has a thousand meanings, it seems difficult to teach machines such things. Added to that, seeing the condition of Indonesia which is less realistic and competent to realize Artificial Intelligence so that it takes quite a long time.",4,4,4,4,4

COMPANIES JUST NEED TO TEACH ROBOTS TO ANSWER THOUSANDS OF QUESTIONS ASKED REGULARLY. THESE ROBOTS CAN ALSO BE TAUGHT TO DETECT GRAMMAR ERRORS, PRONUNCIATION ERRORS, AND EVERYDAY LANGUAGE. HOWEVER, THE IMPLEMENTATION IS NOT THAT EASY. ROBOTS ALSO HAVE LIMITATIONS IN LEARNING THE MEANING OF A MEANING. FOR EXAMPLE, A SENTENCE THAT HAS MULTIPLE MEANINGS.

Companies only need to teach robots to answer thousands of questions that are asked periodically and if they encounter difficulties, people will look for CS. This robot can also detect grammatical errors, pronunciation errors, and everyday language if there are grammatical errors. However, the implementation is not that easy because robots also have limitations in understanding the meaning of a word. For example, there is a sentence that has a double meaning. Deeper knowledge is needed to facilitate conversation and understand each other. Only those who have human feelings and instincts can understand the digestion of words and their meanings. Seeing the current condition of Indonesia, this opinion is still considered unrealistic because it takes a long time and a lot of money to realize AI quickly like that. In addition, people in Indonesia or in Asia also still pay more attention to aspects of communication and language delivery and politeness or attitude. Which in AI cannot be found and arranged like that.",5,5,5,4,4

std-uas-417,202,uas-2,uas,"In my opinion, it could happen. The reason is: because of the increasingly sophisticated development of the era, the technology that is found and created is also increasingly advanced, including in the field of public services. For example, by creating AI for customer service by entering data on FAQ Frequently Asked Questions and some data that may be asked by customers, problem solving and solutions to various problems. With that, AI can answer various customer questions correctly, so that it is possible that one day, human services as customer service will no longer be needed.",4,4,5,5,5
std-uas-418,203,uas-2,uas,"In my opinion, someday customer service jobs and other repetitive jobs can be replaced by machines, because currently many companies rely on chatbots to answer some basic questions from their customers before they face customer service directly.

As humans, it is very normal to feel tired and bored in doing things that are repetitive. Fatigue and boredom will lead to turnover and error tendencies in work. Machines can replace that.

Currently, we have even felt the development of AI which has caused jobs such as customer service to be replaced by machines. An example is the virtual robot owned by Bank BCA named Vira. The development of customer service jobs using these machines can be implemented through one of the AI ​​technologies, namely machine learning. Machine learning ML technology is a machine that is developed to be able to learn on its own without any direction from its users. This learning is developed based on other disciplines and data mining so that machines can learn and analyze data without the need for reprogramming or being ordered. The tasks that can be done by machine learning depend on what it learns. With the application of this technology, repetitive jobs are very likely to be replaced because machines can continue to learn what they do and correct the mistakes they make by themselves without requiring a command.",5,5,5,5,5
std-uas-426,211,uas-2,uas,"In my opinion, this can happen because by mapping the signals received by the machine in the form of sentences, phrases, words from customers, either through intonation, syntax, etc., we can group them and create a program that makes the machine respond in a certain pattern according to the signal classification.",3,4,5,4,3
std-uas-427,212,uas-2,uas,"Yes, I think so. Because in the future many people will realize how effective and efficient it is if a job is done by a machine.

In terms of definition, data storage, which uses analytical reports, has been generated from a single process, which is nothing but traditional data. Big data is primarily a technology, which stands on the volume, velocity, and variety of data. Volume defines the amount of data coming from different sources, velocity refers to the speed of data processing, and variety refers to the number of data types mainly supporting all types of data formats. ACCEPTED DATA SOURCE Accepted one or more homogeneous all sites use the same DBMS product or heterogeneous data sources sites can run different DBMS products.

Accepted type of formats Handles mainly structural data especially relational data. Accepts all types of formats. Structured data, relational data, and unstructured data including text documents, emails, videos, audios, stock ticker data and financial transactions. TIME-VARIANT Data collected in data warehouse is actually identified by a specific time period. Because most of the data is historical for analytical reports. Big data has many approaches to identify the loaded data, time period is one of the approaches above. Since Big data mainly processes flat files, archiving with date and time will be the best approach to identify the loaded data.

std-uas-552,122,uas-3,uas,"characteristics that distinguish big data from traditional data. Flexibility Traditional databases are based on fixed schemas that are static in nature. They can only work with structured data that fits easily into relational databases or tables. In reality, most data is unstructured. The vast variety of unstructured data requires new methods to store and process. Some examples include movies and sound files, images, documents, geolocation data, text, weblogs, strings, and web content. Big data uses dynamic schemas that can include both structured and unstructured data. Data is stored in its raw form and schemas are applied only when accessing it. For big data analytics, datasets from multiple sources are added, and then functions such as storing, cleaning, distributing, indexing, transforming, searching, accessing, analyzing, and visualizing are performed. Real-time analytics Traditionally, analytics always happened after the event or time period being analyzed. With big, analytics happens in real-time as the data is collected and findings are presented virtually instantaneously. This capability enables breakthroughs in the medical, safety, smart city, manufacturing, and transportation domains. Distributed architecture While traditional data is based on a centralized database architecture, big data uses a distributed architecture. Computation is distributed across multiple computers in a network. This makes big data much more scalable than traditional data, in addition to providing better performance and cost benefits. The use of commodity hardware, open source software, and cloud storage makes storing big data more economical. After data quality checks and data normalization are performed, the data is modeled so that it can be stored in a data warehouse. Multiple sources Traditionally, data sources were quite limited. Today there is an explosion of data thanks to multiple sources that capture data almost all the time. Readings from medical devices, air particle counters, mass density calculators, and embedded devices in vehicles are just a few examples that demonstrate the large volume, as well as variety, of big data from multiple sources. Enables exploratory analysis In the traditional approach to data analytics, users have to define their questions up front. The data is structured to find answers to their questions and then reports are generated. However, big data enables a more iterative and exploratory approach. The focus is on developing a platform for creative discovery so that users can explore what questions can be asked. In a business scenario, the traditional approach leads to monthly reports, productivity analysis, customer survey findings, etc. Big data provides insights into sentiment analysis, product strategy, asset utilization, preventative maintenance of equipment, etc. To get all the benefits of big data analytics, experts and technology platforms have to overcome several challenges. These relate to scale, heterogeneity, lack of structure, error handling, privacy, timeliness, provenance, and visualization. Although there are challenges at all stages from data acquisition to interpretation, big data analytics technologies and tools are evolving every day.",5,5,5,5,5

So that repeated questions and problems can be answered simply with the help of a bot. Another example is a nurse who is tasked with delivering food to patients. This job can be replaced by a robot. Thus, of course, various new jobs will emerge, especially in the IT field. The types of new jobs such as Hackers in a positive way, for example to uncover crimes, such as admins in controlling the use of bots, and so on.

This can happen as technology develops, especially in the field of AI, considering that one of the goals of AI is to carry out an activity that generally requires human intelligence. Some examples of jobs that can be replaced by machines are: drivers, waiters, and cashiers. However, as these jobs decrease, new jobs will emerge. The emergence of these new jobs is related to the development of existing technology. For example, in this Big Data era, special skills are needed in processing data, so that the Big Data Analyst job has emerged. In facing this technological shift, the main capital for us to survive is to continue to develop our potential in order to compete.

This is because the company wants to reduce their production costs, they don't need to pay workers every month, they only need periodic maintenance costs which may be cheaper and also want to ensure that the quality of the product remains good. Meanwhile, the emergence of new types of jobs in the future is also related to the world of technology where people compete to create new businesses so as to create new jobs. The logic is like this: those who have just created a business still need workers because they don't have the money to buy machines. In the end, such changes are inevitable, so from now on we must prepare by being friends with technology and being tech-savvy. In addition, maybe when we will later create a new business, we can consider which parts should use machines, which ones should not.

There are humans who are so ambitious about AI projects until they find a maximum point that is unknown when 2. There are humans who are so afraid of the system because humans will not be able to catch up with the development of the system if the system is at its maximum. These ambitious people are people who have wealth, and no longer think about how to get money. So the money they have is to reach a maximum point for the new system. While people who are worried are people who work every day to stay alive. So their fear is the fear of whether they will be able to stay alive if the system exists or not.

However, if some customers are not satisfied with the service from AI, usually applications that use AI facilitate the Real Customer Service alternative. Therefore, in my opinion, over time, repetitive work will be replaced little by little because I believe that AI will develop much more than what we see now. and at that time new jobs in the technology field will emerge, for example, now a new job that is on the rise is Digital Marketer.

For example, new jobs are emerging in fields related to the design and operation of the technology itself, such as computer programmers and user interface designers. World trends show that the service sector will be the main job sector in the future. When technology helps the efficiency of the agricultural and manufacturing sectors, the price of goods becomes more affordable. As a result, human time and energy are not used up to meet basic needs.

The attitude and strategy to deal with this is to hone and improve several human skills that are not easily replaced by machines, such as empathy, creativity, and analytical skills for complex problems. We need to hone these abilities by continuing to utilize technological developments. Knowledge that is memorization in nature will be very easily replaced by artificial intelligence.

Seeing this, work clearly comes to mind that in the future there will be new types of jobs that can keep up with technological advances, because if technology continues to advance while we as humans cannot keep up with it and are actually less competitive with things we have created ourselves, then like it or not our existence as creatures at the top of the food chain or those who control and preserve the earth will slowly be replaced by our own handiwork. Our attitude and strategy in dealing with this should be to create a policy where the technology we create should not cause harm to us as humans, and emphasize that the purpose of technology or machines is to help us, make our work easier, not to take over our livelihoods or even oppress us indirectly. Although it sounds old-fashioned, moral values ​​must still be upheld, but of course balanced by advancing our thinking abilities as humans so that we are not less competitive with the technology we have created ourselves.
